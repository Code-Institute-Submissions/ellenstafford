# Porfolio Website - ellenstafford.com


This website is an online porfolio, or resume, designed to showcase my skills and qualifications. It is also a great and intuitive way to learn more about me.

## Project Purpose 

The primary aim of this website is to establish an online presence for myself and to impress potential recruiters who may hire me. Unlike a traditional CV or resume, this online portfolio allows my skills to speak for themselves, with the website itself acting as an exemplar of my current skillset. By using HTML, CSS and a little Javascript, this website gives users an easy and aesthetically pleasing interface for them to effortlessly discover who I am. 

 ### Project Goals 
 
The goal of this site is to portray myself in the best possible light by advertising my skills and assets to potential employers/recruiters who may wish to hire me. The site also functions as a mechanism to showcase my skills, and does this by offering a unique and engaging user interface. The goal is to encourage traffic and increase my prospects in the career world, while also encouraging users to feel inspired; pleased and finally satisfied that their own goals have been met to a high standard. 
 
 ### Target Audience 

The main target audience for this website is recruiters and employers looking for someone to fulfil a role in software or web development. But the site is also open to audiences who simply want to know more about me.
