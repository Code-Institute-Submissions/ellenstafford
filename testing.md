## Automated Testing

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used to validate the project's html and css file. 

### W3C Markup Validation Service

![W3C Markup Validation Service Screenshot](assets/img/w3c_validator.png)

Found only minor errors, such as hanging end tags I had forgot to remove, and typos in the code. 

The validator noted that an ID attribute was called twice, because of me labelling two sections with the same ID by mistake, whilst fixing code. I quickly rectified the issue.

File names on images had spaces which were renamed - fixing the issue.

No major errors were found.


### W3C CSS Validation Service

![W3C CSS Validation Service Screenshot](assets/img/w3c_css.png)

Found no errors.

However, the validator found [these errors](assets/img/CSS-validator.png) in Bootstrap, but as I cannot edit Bootstrap's CSS files directly, I have no choice but to ignore it.

#### Warnings:

- The following warning were ignored as they can be necessary to ensure functionality on different browsers:
    - `-webkit-transition is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-moz-transition is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-o-transition is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-webkit-background-size is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-moz-background-size is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-o-background-size is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-moz-animation is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-webkit-animation is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-webkit-transform is an unknown vendor extension`
    - `-moz-transform is an unknown vendor extension`

- W3C's CSS Validation Service flagged **line 175** as an error.
    - The warning: `auto is not defined by any specification as an allowed value for pointer-events, but is supported in multiple browsers`
    - However, this line is necessary for the functionality of the navbar fullscreen overlay menu - a screenshot of the code can be seen [here](assets/img/navbar_code_screenshot.png)
    - Removing this line breaks the navigation links when on the fullscreen overlay - they will no longer be clickable.
    - Ignoring the warning.

- The service flagged **768 warnings in Bootstrap**. As I cannot address these warning directly, I am forced to ignore it. 


### Page Performance

I used [UpTrends](https://www.uptrends.com/tools/website-speed-test) and Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to check the speed of my website. Here are my results when using the service:

#### Test 1

The first test resulted in a fairly unsatisfactory score.

![UpTrends Test 1](assets/img/uptrends_img1_test1.png)

The major impact to the site's performance/speed was due to render-blocking resources, inefficient encode images and improper image sizes. This resulted in a load time of 2.1s and would cause notable stuttering when scrolling down the page on mobile devices. 


The following image shows the impact of the inefficient image sizes to the performance of my site:

![UpTrends Test 1 Image 2](assets/img/uptrends_img2_test1.png)


It was imperative, then, that I address the issue concerning the image file sizes. To do this, I used [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)

![TinyPNG Image 1](assets/img/tinypng_results_img1.png)
![TinyPNG Image 2](assets/img/tinypng_results_img2.png)

TinyPNG managed to significantly reduce the size of my images, saving me a total of 16 MB - a 72% difference.


### Test 2

Running the second test, after resizing the images, produced fruitful results:

![UpTrends Test 2](assets/img/uptrends_img1_test2.png)

This gave me a 23% increase in performance, and reduced the site's load time by 40%, from 2.1s to 1.5s.


### Test 3 

However this did not mean the site's performance was at its best. I found that my site still had some major performance issues when running through Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) 

| Desktop | Mobile |
| ------- | ------ |
| ![PageSpeed Insights Desktop](assets/img/googlepageinsights_img2_test3.png) | ![PageSpeed Insights Mobile](assets/img/googlepageinsights_img1_test3.png) |

My concern, was the performance impact on mobile, because despite resizing the image files, I still experienced stuttering on mobile devices. Page Insights noted that the images were still impacting performance:

| Desktop | Mobile |
| ------- | ------ |
| ![PageSpeed Insights Desktop](assets/img/googlepageinsights_img4_test3.png) | ![PageSpeed Insights Mobile](assets/img/googlepageinsights_img3_test3.png) |

PageSpeed Insights recommended changing the format of the images from PNG and JPEG to a next-gen format, like webP, which would reduce the screen loading by an estimate of 3.75s on mobile, and 0.67s on desktop. 

- I used multiple online converters to convert my images from PNG to webP, such as [ImageOnline.com](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp), [Convertio](https://convertio.co/png-webp/) and [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/png-to-webp/). 
    - Online converters often have limits on how many files you can convert, so I used multiple converters.

Converting the images didn't have much impact on the Speed Score, however it did drastically reduce the stuttering when scrolling on mobile devices.


### Performance Issues 

The remaining performance impact derives from the render-blocking resources primarily caused by Bootstrap and Font Awesome. The only 'fix' to this issue would be to locally load a limited CSS file for both Bootstrap and Font Awesome, which would *only* call the CSS that I need. 

I tested this on the local repository of the site by doing the following steps:

1. I removed the link to Bootstrap's external stylesheet (CDN). 
2. I copied the *used* Bootstrap CSS code from the deployed website by using the [CSS Used](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-used/cdopjfddjlonogibjahpnmjpoangjfff?hl=en) extension in [Chrome's DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) 
3. I then minified the code using [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.com/)
4. I copied the minified css code into my main CSS file (style.css) before any of my own code.
5. I navigated to the [Bootstrap GitHub Repository](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
6. From there I downloaded `bootstrap-grid.css.min` from *bootstrap/dist/css* and saved it to my assets/css folder in my local directory. 
7. I linked to the newly downloaded `bootstrap.grid.css.min` in my HTML and loaded it before my `style.css` file.
8. I saved the changes made to both `index.html` and `style.css`

This process did work, although it would require some fine tweaking to make it aesthetically identical to the deployed website. I did the same process but using a **Custom Bootstrap CSS** file from [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) in place of `bootstrap-grid.css.min`. This made the site's features more functional but caused visual inconsistencies, such as the font size being a lot smaller than the original website.

There was also the concern of how this would work, if at all, once the website was deployed. Therefore, this may be a 'fix' that I will implement and try to resolve in the future. For now, the issue is not damaging to the site, as the site speed is quick enough to not cause user irritation and intervene with user input. Nevertheless, it will be wise to rectify this issue in the future.

## Testing User Stories

### First Time Visitor Goals 

1. As a first-time visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site immediately.

    - Upon entering the site users are greeted with a clean, user friendly navigation bar at the top of the screen which they can use to go to a page of their choice. Underneath is a hero-image and jumbotron, with the text 'Hi, I'm Ellen. I'm a University Graduate & Freelancer in Software Development' and a button that says 'Learn More' bellow.

    ![Homepage jumbotron](assets/img/userstory_purpose_jumbotron.png)

    - The main purpose of the site is made clear with the hero image and jumbotron - it tells the user that this site is about, me, with 'Hi, I'm Ellen [...]' and that the site's purpose is to serve as an online portfolio to advertise myself.

2. I want to easily navigate through the site's content. 

    - The navigation bar is clear, readable and easy to use. It is fixed which means the user can easily navigate to different parts of the site's page quickly and effortlessly, no matter where they are on the page at that given moment.

    | Desktop | Mobile |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | ![Navbar Desktop](assets/img/userstory_navbar.png) | ![Navbar Mobile](assets/img/userstory_navbar_mobile.png)
    
    - The fullscreen overlay menu for the navigation bar provides greater and easier usability for users on smaller touch screen devices. 

    ![Navbar fullscreen overlay menu](assets/img/userstory_navbar_fullscreenmenu.png)

3. I do not want to decode the site's features to be able to use them - no features should be hard to find or hard to perceive as a feature.

    - Every button that is clickable is an imperative, which tells the user that it is clickable and that they should interact with it. 

    | Learn More Button | Hire Me Button | Read More Button | Send Button | 
    | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | 
    | ![Learn more button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_learnmore.png) | ![Hire me button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_hireme.png) | ![Read More button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_readmore.png) | ![Send button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_send.png) | 

    - No information is hidden, with exception to the project image overlay, which is visible when the mouse hovers over it. Due to the image size, it is unlikely that the user would overlook this feature, particularly as it follows conventions seen on other sites. Nevertheless, a small indication, like a 'hover over me' text, to encourage the user to interact with the image could be added to further improve user experience. 

    ![Projects page - project images](assets/img/userstory_projects.gif)

4. I want to easily find information about the potential candidate I may hire.

    - The fixed navigation bar allows the user to easily navigate to different parts of the site that has the information they require.

    - The 'Learn more' button on the homepage makes it so users can immediately find the information they seek. 

    - Information has been effectively organised so that users can navigate through the site's content, and sift through information easily. 'Read more' buttons are there to indicate to the user that more information can be revealed, which exposes the user to more information without the risk of cognitive overload. 

5. As a first-time visitor, I also want to immediately see the potential of the candidate, which means the site itself needs to meet a desired professional quality.

    - The site fulfils this purpose, but users can also easily navigate to both the Experience page and the Projects page in order to satisfy this goal.

6. I want to be assured that the site is trusted, therefore I want to see social media links to serve as evidence to their major claims.

    - Social media links are provided in the site's footer. There are also references available in the downloadable CV file. 

    ![Social media links](assets/img/userstory_socialmedia.png)

7. Most significantly, as a first-time visitor, I want to *like* the site so that I will revisit it again.

    - The site encourages user interactivity and regularly responds to the user's input. 

    ![Navbar hover effects](assets/img/userstory_navbar.gif)
    
    - The scroll-down and scroll-up arrow buttons give a visually stimulating and effective way for users to navigate through the site, as a navigational feature other than the navbar.

    | Scroll Down | Scroll to Top |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | ![Scroll Down Gif](assets/img/userstory_scrolldown.gif) | ![Scroll to Top Gif](assets/img/userstory_scrollup.gif) 

    - Buttons encourage users to engage with the site.

    | Learn More Button | Hire Me Button | Read More Button | Send Button | Project Links |
    | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
    | ![Learn more button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_learnmore.png) | ![Hire me button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_hireme.png) | ![Read more button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_readmore.png) | ![Send button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_send.png) | ![Project links button](assets/img/userstory_buttons_projectlinks.png) |

    - The implementation of a contact form, alongside contact links, makes the user experience more personal and intuitive. 

    - The image carousel is visually stimulating and unique to this genre of website, which may make the site more memorable and encourage users to visit again.

    ![Image carousel](assets/img/userstory_carousel.gif)


### Returning Visitor Goals 

1. As a returning visitor, I want to see the projects the candidate may have worked on.

    - Users can navigate to the Projects page to see both web development projects and academic work. 

    - The projects are emphasised visually, with the large eye-catching image to grab the users' attention and encourage them to learn more.

2. I want to see their qualifications, relevant work experience and what skills they have.

    - Users can navigate to the Skills page and the Experience page to see my qualifications and skill sets. Both are represented visually with progress bars and a timeline. This makes it quicker for users to take in all the information and offers the information to them in an intuitive way that diminishes the risk of cognitive overload.

3. I want to be able to easily contact the candidate at any point throughout my navigation of the site so that they can answer any question I may have.

    - Users can navigate to the contact footer by either using the navigation bar or clicking the 'Hire Me' button on the about page. 

    - The fixed navbar fulfils this goal by allowing the users to go to the contact section quickly and easily, regardless of where they are in the site.

4. As a returning visitor, I may want to download a CV in PDF format and see references to validate the candidate’s claims.

    - A download icon for the downloadable CV can be found in the footer with the social media links. A hover tooltip will display when the user hovers over the icon with their mouse on desktop. This tells the users exactly what they will download. 

    - When on mobile devices, a text reading 'Download my CV' will be displayed underneath the download icon in place of the hover tooltip to make the feature easy for users to understand and use.

    | CV in PDF Format - Desktop | CV in PDF Format - Mobile |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | ![CV Hover Tooltip](assets/img/userstory_hovertooltip.png) | ![CV on mobile devices](assets/img/userstory_cv_mobile.png)

## Peer Review 

- The project was posted on Slack's **Peer Review** channel, and the feedback I received from other students helped me isolate some final bugs. 

    - The bug that was noted was the **carousel bug** mentioned [here](#carousel-horizontal-scrollbar-bug). It was noted that this bug was impacting the fixed navbar. The student was kind enough to document the bug, as seen here:

![Carousel fixed navbar visual bug](assets/img/carousel_peer_review_bug.gif)

- When trying to replicate the bug with DevTools, I discovered that it was linked to the horizontal scrollbar bug that was documented [here](#carousel-horizontal-scrollbar-bug), however the fixed navbar would only move in the way seen above when on tablet devices. 

- Fixing the horizontal scrollbar bug also fixed this, but without the feedback from Peer Review I may overlooked this bug and not addressed the issue.

## Known Bugs 

### Navigation Bar Fullscreen Overlay

The **fullscreen overlay menu** was added to the project to provide a better user experience for users on mobile devices. When on mobile or tablet devices the navbar would collapse and in its place would be a **hamburger button** to the right side of the navbar. When clicked it would open the fullscreen overlay menu containing the navigation links.

The overlay menu occupies the entire viewport of the device, which makes it easier for users to use on **touchscreen devices**, particularly for those users who own very **small** touchscreen devices. With this layout, navigation links are easier to click. 

This was why I implemented the fullscreen overlay menu to this project, but adding it gave rise to a few bugs.
 
- Without Javascript, users had to manually close the fullscreen overlay menu after clicking a navlink. 
    - This increased the amount of steps required from users and may have easily caused confusion and irritation. 
    - Added JQuery to address this issue and ensure good UX design. 

However, after adding JQuery new problems arised:

Although the fullscreen menu would close after clicking a navlink, as intended, when returning to the hamburger button again the overlay would flash and close. Multiple clicks were required to get it to open again. This is explained in depth in the table below:

| Click No. |       Standard navlink        |       Drop-down menu navlink      |  
| --------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
|   1   | works as intended | overlay menu opens but then closes when clicking the drop-down menu navlink |
|   2   | overlay menu flashes then closes | overlay menu flashes then closes |
|   3   | works as intended - can click the navlink | works as intended - can click the drop-down menu navlink |
|   4   | overlay menu flashes and closes | overlay menu flashes and closes |
|   5   | works as intended | overlay menu opens but them closes when clicking the drop-down menu navlink |
|   6   | overlay menu flashes and closes | overlay menu flashes and closes |
|   7   | works as intended | works as intended |

- The pattern repeats in a perpetual loop


### Navigation Fullscreen Overlay Fix

Before:

``` 
$('.navbar-toggler').click(function() {
  $(this).toggleClass('active');
  $('.navbar-collapse').toggleClass('open').show();
 });

 $('.navbar-collapse li').on('click', function(){
   $(".navbar-collapse").hide();
   $(".navbar-toggler").removeClass("active");
});

```

After (Fixed):
```
$('.navbar-toggler').click(function() {
    $('.navbar-collapse').addClass('open').show();
});


$('.navbar-collapse li').on('click', function(){
 $(".navbar-collapse").removeClass('open').hide();
 if($('.navbar-collapse').hasClass('show')) {
      $('.navbar-collapse').removeClass('show');
  }
});

```

The problem was caused by a conflict with Bootstrap Jquery:
- The collapsible Bootstrap element goes through a series of states as it collapses - from open, to moving, to close and vice versa.
- But the main problem derived from the 'show' class.
    - The 'show' class in the Jquery above (before the fix) is what is getting left over after hiding the overlay.
    - However Bootstrap uses the same 'show' class to denote elements that can be seen. 

Steps to fix the code:
- Checked to see if the 'show' class was still present after hiding the overlay.
- After seeing it was, removed it.
- Bootstrap will then re-add the class the next time the navigation menu is opened.
- Removed the 'active' class as it did not do anything.
    
    - A big thank you to Scott Kipp from Code Institue for fixing this issue.

### Experience Page Navigation 

- Navigation via the navbar does not always work when navigating to the **Education** or **Work Experience** section once in the Experience page. 

- The characteristics of this bug is illustrated bellow (a **fail** means there is no response when the link is clicked):

    - Homepage > Education > Work Experience - Fail 
    - Homepage > Work Experience > Education - Fail 
    - Homepage > Education > Achievements > Work Experience > Education - Fail
    - Homepage > Work Experience > Achievements > Work Experience > Education - Fail
    - Homepage > Work Experience > Achievements > Education > Work Experience - Fail

- There is problem when navigation from **Education** to **Work Experience** and vice versa 

    - Currently the root cause of this problem has not been isolated.
    - It is yet to be fixed.

### Carousel Page Jump Bug

Transitioning to the **Skyrim carousel image** caused the whole webpage to jump.

The bug wasn't fixed completely but was drastically minimised.

- Each carousel item has top and bottom padding added to it via inline css. 
    
    - Not every carousel image is the same height, but to ensure minimal page jumping each carousel image must have a total height of 250px. Therefore, padding was added to each image so that its total height was the sum of 250px.

    - To find the correct padding for each carousel item I made the following calculation: `250px - *height of image* / 2 = value for padding top and padding bottom`

    - Bellow is sample of my HTML code to further illustrate this method:

    ```
    <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="assets/img/dracula.png" alt="Seventh slide: Bram Stoker's Dracula logo" class="d-block"
        style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
        <div class="carousel-caption">
            <h3>Dracula</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="assets/img/great_gatsby.png" alt="Eighth slide: The Great Gatsby logo (text)" class="d-block"
        style="padding-top: 52px; padding-bottom: 52px;">
        <div class="carousel-caption">
            <h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="assets/img/jane_eyre.png" alt="Ninth slide: Jayne Eyre custom logo" class="d-block"
        style="padding-top: 38px; padding-bottom: 38px;">
        <div class="carousel-caption">
            <h3>Jane Eyre</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="assets/img/red_dead_redemption.png" alt="Tenth slide: Red Dead Redemption game logo" class="d-block"
        style="padding-top: 72px; padding-bottom: 72px;">
        <div class="carousel-caption">
            <h3>Red Dead Redemption</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```
- The problem was that the padding for the Skyrim icon was too big, causing the whole webpage to jump. 

    - Changing the padding from 25px for the top and bottom padding to 14px helped minimise the problem.

### Carousel Horizontal Scrollbar Bug

When transitioning to the next or previous slide a visual bug occured, where the horizontal scrollbar flashes at the bottom of the screen, as seen here:

| Before Fix | After Fix |
| ---------- | --------- |
| ![Carousel horizontal scrollbar visual bug screen recording](assets/img/carousel_scrollbar_bug.gif) | ![Carousel fixed screen recording](assets/img/carousel_scrollbar_fixed.gif) |

- The problem was caused by the following line of CSS code:

    ```
    .carousel-inner {
        overflow: visible;
    }
    ```
    - Removing this line of code completely **fixed** the issue.

    - Changing the code to: `overflow: hidden;` also fixed the issue, but it didn't seem to do anything else beyond that.
       
        - Removing the code was the most efficient solution.

### iOS Safari 

When sharing the website with friends and family members, those who used Safari browser on iOS operating system found:

- None of the site's images would load.

    - After research it was discovered that the problem was linked to the image format: webP
    - Apple have only just added support for webP images for the first time in Safari - for Safari 14 **only**
    - Apple users with a version lower than **Safari 14** would not see the images
        - A iPhone 7 user and an MacBook Air user reported that none of the site's images loaded on their device

- Images were converted back to PNG format to ensure compatibility on a wide range of devices

    - This came at a slight performance hit cost - a reason why the images were converted to webP format in the first place.
    - Ensuring functionality on a wide range of devices takes precedence over a small performance boost.

### Tablet Devices 

When testing on a **Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet** (dimensions: 167 × 254 × 6.1 mm; pixels: 2560 x 1600) in landscape mode, the background for the **callout card** on the **About Me** page was cut off half way, meaning the text flowed outside of the card's background.

- This problem is difficult to address as the visual bug does is not visible when in DevTools. 


-----


### Performance 

On first loading the site, the images can be a little slow to load and sometimes slight stuttering occurs when scrolling down the page. This often stops once the site has had time to load fully. More details are mentioned [here](#page-performance)
