# Testing 

## Automated Testing

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used to validate the project's html and css file. 

### W3C Markup Validation Service

Found only minor errors, such a hanging end tags that I had forgot to remove, and typos in the code. 

The validator noted that an ID attribute was called twice, which was due to me mistakingly labelling two sections with the same ID whilst fixing code. I quickly rectified the issue.

File names on images had spaces which were promptly renamed, fixing the issue.

Other than that no major erros were found.


### W3C CSS Validation Service

Found no errors
